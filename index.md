## This is a program to help you find a movie to watch!
The goal of this project was to create a movie recommendation program. It works by taking user input to create a set of parameters from which a list of potential movies is returned to the user. 
## Features
Through this program you can search for movies based on genre, release year, IMDb user rating and popularity!
## Demo
Here is a quick example of how the program works:

## Installation 
To install and run the program simply download all the files in the ["movie_finder" folder](https://github.com/nicc00/movie-finder/tree/master/movie_finder), and make sure they are stored in the same folder on your device.
